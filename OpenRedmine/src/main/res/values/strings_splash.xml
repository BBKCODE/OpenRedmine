"Looking back on corporate life"













Management is a hoax.











It is evil.











People who make a big deal their "management", are just inviting trouble.

They try to keep up with everything going on around them.


For them, if there is something that is to do with their "management", they jump at it without second thought. 

If you fail in with them, lies, secrets, failure, and even crime await you.

But for them, it is just the spice of working.


And if failure is also the mark of "management", then 

is not it ironic, that a person who has failed to make project,

is also technically leading his "management".




Though I wonder if they would agree. Everything runs on their schedule.


Let me be clear. The people who enjoy their "management", will eventually fall apart.
